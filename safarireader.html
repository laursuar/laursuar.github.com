<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>To solve this problem, I looked at the stackoverflow question referenced 
in the lab assignment. As the assignment states, the question is rather 
inconclusive and not extremely helpful. What was helpful, however, was noticing
that the lab assignment itself is a .html file that triggers the safari reader
 function. From this I compared the source code from the lab assignment website
 with the answer stated in stack overflow. </p>
<p> The first solution I attempted was merely adding a < section > 
tag (without the spaces) to denote that this is a section that should trigger 
safari's reader function. </p>
<h2>First Attempt</h2>
The first attempt, using merely the section tag, failed. I am now going to try 
using the div tag.
<h2>Second Attempt</h2>
<p>The second attempt, using both the div and the section tag, failed. I am 
now going to re-review the stackoverflow question as well as the source code
 for the assignment page</p>
<h2>Third Attempt</h2>
<p> I am now going to switch the section and div tags, starting first with the 
div which will be followed by the section tag. After the initial attempt, 
Safari still refuses to activate the reader tag. Do I have to add images and 
content besides plain text? Do I have to add a cascading style sheet? </p>
<h3>NOTE:</h3>
<p>I've just learned thanks to mathiasbynens.be/notes/safari-reader that there 
is a chance reader does not work on local files, and this may be the reason my 
safari browswer isn't activating reader. Attempting this change now. </p>
<h2>Fourth and Final Attempt</h2>
<p>I have successfully managed to trigger the reader with this code. <br>
The critical steps are the following, taken from mathiasbynens.be/notes/safari-reader:
<ol><li>A tag such as < section > or < div > must wrap around the entire code that is to appear in reader</li>
<li>There must be at least 5 elements (< br > lines count as single elements) within the wrapper element </li>
<li>The file must not be a local file</li></ol> 
</p>
</section>
