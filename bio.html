  <h1>Laura Su&aacute;rez</h1>
  <div class="bio">
  <p>was born in Puerto Rico on a Friday evening. In 2004, she moved to the best state in the union, Vacationland.  Laura was fascinated in the world around her, and loved exploring the changing themes of the environments around her through canvas and acrylics.  Her parents' basement is still a makeshift studio housing watercolors, mixed media, boards and canvases of the reality of the life around her.  She surrounded herself with the arts from a young age, taking especially to literature, painting, and film.  As a student at Tufts University, she quickly gravitated towards Philosophy and took her free time to explore other fields with which she had no prior experience. She shuffled around, studying everything from Cognitive Science and Linguistics,  to Computer Science.  After taking Introduction to Latin American Art with Adriana Zavala, a new passion awoke in her (or an old love, revisited), leader her to a drastic change and pursuit of Art and Art History.  In her free time, Laura still enjoys painting, playing the banjo, and exploring her favorite cities. </p>
