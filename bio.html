  <h1>Laura Suarez</h1>
  <p>was born in Puerto Rico on a Friday evening. In 2004, she moved to the best state in the union, Vacationland.         She has had a keen interest in computers from a young age, particularly the ability of the internet to connect people from all over the world to otherwise inaccesible information, to unending fountains of knowledge, and most importantly, to other people. In 2010, she started her undergraduate education at Tufts University. After nearly completing a
Philosophy major, she started exploring other fields from Linguistics (which she still loves), Cognitive Science (which she still loves), and Computer Science, all quite interconnected fields. She's interested in continuing developing her skills as a programmer and her people skills.  She would like to study Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing in the future. In between her walks from Miner to Halligan, Laura likes listening to Joanna Newsom, cooking hearty stews, setting volleyballs and trying to learn to knit. Oh and becoming the very best that no one ever was. </p>
