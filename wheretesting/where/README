overview
	1. Maps all the stations on the Red Line using Google Maps API version 
	   3. A distinct icon marker (i.e., something other than the default 
	   Google Maps icon for markers) must be used for all stations, and a 
	   red polyline connecting all the stations must be rendered. Clicking 
	   on a marker will display an info window with the name of the station.
	2. Detects and maps your current location via navigator.geolocation 
	   JavaScript object. An info window marking your location (e.g., "I am
	   here at...") must be attached to your marker and displayed on the
	   map.
	3. Displays the closest Red Line station to your current location with 
	   approximate distance away (in miles).
	4. Clicking on a subway station marker will display an info window with
	   the name of the station and arrival schedule (southbound and 
	   northbound) for each station on the Red Line.  
	5. Retrieves and displays the locations of Carmen Sandiego and Waldo.
	6. Displays the distance (in miles) between you and Carmen Sandiego, 
	   and you and Waldo. You can display this as an overlay on top of map 
	   or on a side of the map.
