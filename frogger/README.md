## Frogger Part II

### Correctly Implemented
+ Board is loaded on first load
+ A function calculates basic game scoring
+ Included .gitignore file (stores old versions of frogger for reference)
+ Frogger can be moved on the canvas using the up down right left keys
+ Vehicles and logs are animated
+ There is some very sketchy collision detection

### Incorrectly Implemented
+ Frog can't get on the logs (thinks it's a collision)
+ Only one playable frog (once you reach home the game doesn't end.)
+ Game doesn't end on collisions
+ That's pretty much it I think

### Collaboration
+ No outside collaboration

### Hours completing assignment
+ 30 hours and counting (not including Frogger Part I) [i think i might have add lol not funny but like my life.]

### Tokens
+ 2 tokens used
