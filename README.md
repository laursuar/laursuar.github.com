COMP 20: Web Programming // Ming Chow
===================


CORRECTLY IMPLEMENTED:
TLDR;	All aspects correctly implemented, except for an error the html5 
	validator keeps throwing at me. I contend the validator is wrong.

	- All of my .html files pass certification without errors 
	save resume.html (see section below on incorrect implementations) and
	both of my .css files pass certification without errors. 
	- All files (including directories) are in my special repo, 
	laursuar.github.com; My github username is laursuar
	- I am including a README file.
	- Both of my css files have at least 5 rules, and the two files are 
	not identical
	- The three pagess I have are named index.html, resume.html and 
	bio.html. To access index.html simply go to laursuar.github.com.
	To access the other two pages add the extension from the index page.
	- No frames are used, all styling is done in the css.
	- Only relative URLs were used
	- No javascript or Bootstrap (although I wanted to!)
	- Filenames meet specifications
	
INCORRECTLY IMPLEMENTED:
	- I stubbornly decided to leave in a link to my web page. The link 
	includes an ampersand which causes errors when passed through the
	html5 validator (it expects a sort of '&hearts;' situation but it 
	doesn't get it because it's a part of the uri). I believe this is 
	still okay, and a fault of the validator's. 

COLLABORATED WITH:
	- I used stackoverflow.com for general resources on how to implement
	certain things. In particular my wrapper id and my position/date 
	classes relied heavily on stackoverflow forums. 
	- I asked peers to review my webpage and judge its usability.
	
APPROX. HOURS SPENT:
	- I have spent about 15 hours working on this assignement
	(non-consecutive). (It took me a very long time to get centering on the
	page on all browsers).
